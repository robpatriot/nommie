      Before any pnpm commands, source `apps/backend/.env` once per shell session:
      set -a; source apps/backend/.env; set +a
      Do not source the env file repeatedly in the same shell.
      After completing backend code changes, run the linter: `pnpm be:lint`.
      After completing backend development or when testing during development, run tests: `pnpm be:test`.
      You may append additional arguments to run specific test subsets.

      Follow these rules exactly. If a request would break them, stop and ask.
      No deprecated or legacy code: never use `#[deprecated]` or leave legacy/compatibility functions. Refactor callers instead.

      When renaming or moving files, always use `git mv` (for tracked files) or `mv` (for untracked files).
      Never manually recreate files when moving/renaming - this loses git history and makes it difficult to compare changes.
      Example: `git mv apps/backend/src/extractors/old_name.rs apps/backend/src/extractors/new_name.rs`

      No commentary in edits — implement directly.
      Do not reference prompt artifacts in code comments. Implementation plans, step lists, or staged change descriptions provided by prompts should not appear in code comments.
      Keep comments focused on code rationale, invariants, and non-obvious behavior only.
      Code comments should not be historical records. Do not document that code was moved, deleted, or changed. Comments should only explain current behavior and clarify non-obvious aspects of the code as it exists now.
      Code comments should not signpost code elsewhere. Do not add comments that only point to where code is located (e.g., "X is in Y", "see Y"). Comments should explain current behavior, not direct readers to other files or modules.
