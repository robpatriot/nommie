//! Game context combining game-wide and player-specific state.
//!
//! This module provides GameContext, which unifies game identification,
//! historical data, and optional player-specific round information into
//! a single cohesive structure used by both HTTP handlers and AI systems.

/// Complete game context available at any point in a game.
///
/// Combines game-wide data (id, history) with optional player-specific
/// current round information. Used by both HTTP handlers and AI systems.
///
/// # Progressive Enhancement
///
/// Fields are optional to support different game states:
/// - **Lobby**: Just `game_id`
/// - **Game started**: `game_id` + `history`
/// - **Player action**: `game_id` + `history` + `round_info`
/// - **AI player**: All fields + `round_memory`
///
/// # For AI Developers
///
/// Use `GameContext` to access game-wide information:
/// - **Game history**: Complete history of all rounds for strategic analysis
/// - **Round info**: Current round state from your perspective
/// - **Round memory**: Your AI's memory of played cards (based on memory_level)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// fn choose_bid(&self, state: &CurrentRoundInfo, context: &GameContext) -> Result<u8, AiError> {
///     // Access game history for strategic decisions
///     let history = context.game_history().ok_or(...)?;
///     
///     // Analyze opponent patterns over recent rounds
///     let recent_rounds = history.rounds.iter().rev().take(5);
///     for round in recent_rounds {
///         // Analyze bidding patterns, trump choices, etc.
///     }
///     
///     // Make informed bid
///     let legal_bids = state.legal_bids()?;
///     Ok(legal_bids[0])
/// }
/// ```
