/// Information visible to a player at a decision point for the current round.
///
/// This is the primary interface between the game engine and AI players. It provides
/// complete visible game state and helper methods to query legal moves.
///
/// Used by both AI players (passed to [`crate::ai::AiPlayer`] trait methods) and
/// to render UI for human players.
///
/// # For AI Developers
///
/// When implementing [`crate::ai::AiPlayer`], you receive this struct in every decision method.
/// It contains everything you can see as a player at that point in the game.
///
/// ## Key Fields
///
/// - **Your hand**: [`hand`](Self::hand) - cards you can currently play
/// - **Current phase**: [`game_state`](Self::game_state) - Bidding, TrumpSelection, or TrickPlay
/// - **Bids**: [`bids`](Self::bids) - who has bid what so far
/// - **Trick state**: [`current_trick_plays`](Self::current_trick_plays) - cards played this trick
/// - **Scores**: [`scores`](Self::scores) - cumulative scores for all players
///
/// ## Helper Methods
///
/// **Always use these** instead of implementing game rules yourself:
///
/// - [`legal_bids()`](Self::legal_bids) - valid bids you can make (handles dealer restriction)
/// - [`legal_plays()`](Self::legal_plays) - valid cards to play (handles follow-suit rule)
/// - [`legal_trumps()`](Self::legal_trumps) - valid trump choices (all 5 options)
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// fn choose_bid(&self, state: &CurrentRoundInfo) -> Result<u8, AiError> {
///     // Get legal options
///     let legal_bids = state.legal_bids()
///         .map_err(|e| AiError::Internal(format!("{e}")))?;
///     
///     // Analyze your hand
///     let high_cards = state.hand.iter()
///         .filter(|c| matches!(c.rank, Rank::Jack | Rank::Queen | Rank::King | Rank::Ace))
///         .count();
///     
///     // Make decision
///     let target = (high_cards / 2) as u8;
///     legal_bids.iter()
///         .min_by_key(|&&b| (b as i16 - target as i16).abs())
///         .copied()
///         .ok_or_else(|| AiError::InvalidMove("No legal bids".into()))
