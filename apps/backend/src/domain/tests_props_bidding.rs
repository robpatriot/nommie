//! Property tests for bidding logic (pure domain, no DB).
//!
//! Ruleset Contract (minimal implementation):
//! - Players bid sequentially starting from dealer + 1
//! - Each player bids exactly once
//! - Bids must be in range [0..=hand_size]
//! - Turn order must be respected
//! - After all bids are placed, highest bidder wins (ties go to earliest bidder)
