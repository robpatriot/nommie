//! Property-based tests for domain layer card-play legality and trick-winner rules.
//!
//! Developer notes:
//! - Increase cases locally with: PROPTEST_CASES=800 pnpm be:test
//! - Generators ensure unique cards; use prop_assume! to skip invalid setups.
//! - Oracle comparator is independent of main logic to catch regressions.
//!
//! All tests are pure (no DB, no HTTP) and deterministic.
