# Next Steps

- in dev-db and local-prod certs are generated every time into /opt but then only copied if they don't exist in /var/lib/postgre... which means they will almost always differ which is confusing
- fix stop process
- Fix initial load of lobby games list
- lag on all page loads
- Test no interaction for extended period then continuing
- Complete mobile design - Milestone 17
