# ðŸŽ² Nommie Game Rules

This project implements *Nomination Whist* with the following fixed ruleset.
These rules are **locked** â€” all game logic, extractors, tests, and UI must conform.

---

## Players
- Always exactly **4 players**.
- Fixed **turn order** (clockwise).

---

## Rounds
- The game lasts **26 rounds**.
- Hand size schedule:
  13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 
  2, 2, 2, 2,
  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
- Each round is dealt from a freshly shuffled standard 52-card deck.
- **Dealer** rotates clockwise each round.

---

## Bidding
- Each player must make exactly **one bid** per round.
- Valid bids are integers `0 â€¦ hand_size`.
- The **dealer always bids last**.
  - Dealerâ€™s restriction: cannot choose a bid that would make
    `sum(all 4 bids) == hand_size`.
- A player may bid **0**, but cannot do so **more than three rounds in a row**.
  - After three consecutive 0-bids, that player must bid at least 1 in the next round.
- Once all 4 bids are in:
  - **Highest bid** wins the right to select trump.
  - If tied, the earliest bidder among the tied players wins.

---

## Trump Selection
- The winning bidder chooses the **trump suit** for that round.
  - Valid choices: â™ , â™¥, â™¦, â™£, or **No Trumps**.
- If **No Trumps** is chosen:
  - There are *no trump cards* for that round.
  - Each trick is won by the **highest card of the lead suit**.
  - All other suits have no special power.

---

## Trick Play
- The **player to the left of the dealer** leads the first trick of each round.
- Players must **follow suit** if able.
- If no card of the lead suit, they may play any card.
- Trick winner:
  - If the round has a trump suit **and** any trump cards are played, the trick is won by the **highest trump**.
  - Otherwise (either **No Trumps** round, or **no trump cards were played**), the trick is won by the **highest card of the lead suit**.
- Trick winner leads the next trick.
- Each round has exactly **hand_size tricks**.

---

## Scoring
- Each trick won = **+1 point**.
- If a player wins **exactly as many tricks as they bid**, they gain a **+10 bonus**.
  - Applies even to a bid of 0 (if they take no tricks).
- Scores are cumulative across all 26 rounds.

---

## Game End
- After Round 26, the game ends.
- Player(s) with the **highest total score** win.
- If multiple players tie, they are declared **joint winners**.
